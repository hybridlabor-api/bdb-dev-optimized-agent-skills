# Agent Memory Skill

This skill provides a persistent, searchable memory bank that automatically syncs with project documentation. It runs as an MCP server to allow reading/writing/searching of long-term memories.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18+)

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   Clone the `agentMemory` project into your agent's workspace or a parallel directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/webzler/agentMemory.git .agent/skills/agent-memory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:

   ```bash
   cd .agent/skills/agent-memory
   npm install
   npm run compile
   ```

3. **Start the MCP Server**:
   Use the helper script to activate the memory bank for your current project:

   ```bash
   npm run start-server <project_id> <absolute_path_to_target_workspace>
   ```

   _Example for current directory:_

   ```bash
   npm run start-server my-project $(pwd)
   ```

## Capabilities (MCP Tools)

### `memory_search`

Search for memories by query, type, or tags.

- **Args**: `query` (string), `type?` (string), `tags?` (string[])
- **Usage**: "Find all authentication patterns" -> `memory_search({ query: "authentication", type: "pattern" })`

### `memory_write`

Record new knowledge or decisions.

- **Args**: `key` (string), `type` (string), `content` (string), `tags?` (string[])
- **Usage**: "Save this architecture decision" -> `memory_write({ key: "auth-v1", type: "decision", content: "..." })`

### `memory_read`

Retrieve specific memory content by key.

- **Args**: `key` (string)
- **Usage**: "Get the auth design" -> `memory_read({ key: "auth-v1" })`

### `memory_stats`

View analytics on memory usage.

- **Usage**: "Show memory statistics" -> `memory_stats({})`

## Dashboard

This skill includes a standalone dashboard to visualize memory usage.

```bash
npm run start-dashboard <absolute_path_to_target_workspace>
```

Access at: `http://localhost:3333`

## When to Use
This skill is applicable to execute the workflow or actions described in the overview.

## Limitations
- Use this skill only when the task clearly matches the scope described above.
- Do not treat the output as a substitute for environment-specific validation, testing, or expert review.
- Stop and ask for clarification if required inputs, permissions, safety boundaries, or success criteria are missing.

## 1. Overview
This skill provides domain-specific logic and rules for its respective BDB pipeline component to ensure standardization across multi-agent workflows.

## 3. Core Process
1. Read the provided context and ensure preconditions are met.
2. Run the required script or tool and confirm the state change.
3. Verify exit codes, file modifications, or DB counts to guarantee success before reporting completion.

## 4. Common Rationalizations
| Rationalization | Reality |
|---|---|
| "The code change was small, so I skipped updating OpenWiki docs." | Every state change must be reflected in the relevant system records. |
| "The ingest script exited without an error, so the memB index must be updated." | Silent failures happen; explicit verification of the side effect is mandatory. |
| "I'll let the /startcycle proceed without a defined rollback path." | Proceeding without a rollback path corrupts the workflow integrity and safety. |
| "I trust the cached agent registry instead of rescanning after a skill change." | Caches stale out quickly; explicit rescans prevent ghost failures. |

## 5. Red Flags
- Bypassing the verification step after a script execution.
- Proceeding to the next pipeline stage without confirming the previous stage's side effects.
- Ignoring domain-specific constraints listed in this skill.

## 6. Verification
- [ ] Verified script exit codes are explicitly checked.
- [ ] Confirmed target files or database records reflect the expected change.
- [ ] Ensured no silent failures were ignored before reporting success.
