# Architectural Decision Records (ADRs)

This document records the foundational architectural decisions, rationale, and constraints across the **BDB Agent OS Ecosystem**.

---

## ADR-001: Strict Privacy & Zero PII Leakage
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Agent skill configurations and documentation are distributed to multiple developer environments and open/private repositories.
- **Decision:** Enforce a mandatory ban on hardcoded local usernames, absolute user home directory paths, raw tokens, and connection credentials across all code, documentation, and agent prompts. Use `~` or dynamic environment variables (`$HOME`, `%USERPROFILE%`).
- **Consequences:** Ensures universal portability across macOS, Linux, and Windows without risking personal information exposure.

---

## ADR-002: Direct API Execution for OpenWiki Daemon
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Earlier versions spawned sub-instances of the `agy` CLI client to update documentation via prompt loops.
- **Decision:** Replace recursive agent process invocation with direct API calls against fast, lightweight LLM endpoints.
- **Consequences:** Eliminates recursive agent loops, process deadlocks, and excessive token burn while accelerating wiki update cycles to sub-minute latencies.

---

## ADR-003: Core Mandatory memB Semantic Memory Layer
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** AI agents frequently lose long-term context across session restarts, leading to repeated questioning and forgotten design decisions.
- **Decision:** Mandate `memB` as a non-toggleable core dependency bundled with a local 30MB ONNX embedding model (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`) and local SQLite database (`~/.MemBDB/memb.db`).
- **Consequences:** Provides zero-latency, private, local semantic recall across all agent interactions without dependency on cloud vector services.

---

## ADR-004: Multi-Provider LLM Flexibility for OpenWiki
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Different deployment environments (air-gapped workstations, high-throughput cloud runners, or rate-limited free tiers) require different LLM backends. Relying exclusively on one API provider limits flexibility.
- **Decision:** Implement a dual-engine architecture in `openwiki_daemon.py`: a native Google GenAI adapter (`google-genai` SDK) and a universal OpenAI-compatible REST protocol adapter. Expose provider switching via `OPENWIKI_PROVIDER`, `OPENWIKI_MODEL`, and `OPENWIKI_BASE_URL` supporting Google (Gemma 4), Groq, Grok/xAI, Nvidia NIM, OpenRouter, OpenAI, and local runners (Ollama, LM Studio).
- **Consequences:** Allows instant fallback, local offline execution, and provider agility with zero modifications to codebase scanning logic.

---

## ADR-005: Git-Only Deterministic Code Health Analytics (Zero-Token Engine)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Calculating codebase hotspot velocity, author churn, single-contributor bus factor, and file modification frequencies via LLMs is slow, costly, and prone to hallucinations.
- **Decision:** Implement RepoGraph analytics purely via local Git commit history analysis (e.g. `git log`, `git shortlog`) with zero external LLM token consumption. Generate both structured Markdown reports (`.openwiki/code_health.md`) and an interactive 6-panel SVG dashboard (`.openwiki/code_health_dashboard.html`).
- **Consequences:** Sub-second execution, zero API token cost, mathematical accuracy on code churn, and real-time 60-second dashboard auto-refresh.

---

## ADR-006: Modular Extension Decoupling (Creator Suite vs. Core Skills)
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Heavy generative 3D pipelines (TRELLIS, TripoSR), automated cinema video suites (OpenMontage, Remotion Video-Shotcraft, Palmier Pro NLE MCP), and local ComfyUI model weights add tens of gigabytes of dependencies and complex CUDA/toolchain requirements.
- **Decision:** Decouple these heavy creative engines into an independent companion repository (`bdb-dev-creator-extension`). Maintain `bdb-dev-optimized-agent-skills` as a lean, ultra-fast universal core skills backbone with optional add-on links during installation.
- **Consequences:** Keeps the primary agent skills pack fast to install and lightweight to clone (<25MB), while providing deep creative generative pipelines for specialized workstations via the extension repo.

---

## ADR-007: Unified Package Installer for Pro and Basic Tiers
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Maintaining separate repositories and NPM packages for the "Pro" and "Basic" tiers of the agent skills led to CI/CD overhead, duplicated NPM workflows, and fragmented release pipelines.
- **Decision:** Consolidate the "Basic" tier into the primary `bdb-dev-optimized-agent-skills` package by introducing dynamic tier selection in the CLI installer (`installer.js`). The installer intelligently filters out heavy creative MCPs and specific pro skills when "Basic" is selected.
- **Consequences:** Eliminates the need for a separate basic repository and NPM package, creating a single source of truth, simplifying updates, and providing users with a unified `npx` entry point.

---

## ADR-008: Six-Pillar Godmode Skill Hierarchy
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** High-level agent orchestration requires distinct domain governance across engineering, user interface design, delivery/shipping, physical event tech, 3D creation, and media generation to maintain consistent execution standards.
- **Decision:** Establish a six-pillar supreme domain governance architecture: `godmode-engineering`, `godmode-ui-ux`, `godmode-shipping`, `godmode-eventtech`, `godmode-3d-creation`, and `godmode-media-creation`. All domain-specific sub-skills and agent workflows route through these primary authority pillars.
- **Consequences:** Streamlines agent decision-making, prevents rule conflict across specialized tools, and enforces uniform quality thresholds across all creative and technical domains.

---

## ADR-009: Universal Harness & Cross-IDE Configuration Sync
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Developers and teams use diverse IDEs and agent interfaces (Antigravity, Claude Code/Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, Roo Code / Cline, ChatGPT Codex CLI, Aider, VS Code), leading to fragmented rule maintenance and out-of-sync MCP configs.
- **Decision:** Implement a Universal Agent Harness Sync subsystem within the interactive installer to automatically inject and harmonize prompt rules, system instructions, and MCP tool configurations across all 8 supported agent environments.
- **Consequences:** Guarantees 1:1 parity in agent capabilities, memory access, and tool availability regardless of which IDE or CLI runner is active.

---

## ADR-010: Bundled Heimdall Context Compression Engine
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Raw output from CLI tools, test runners, and system commands consumes excessive token context, resulting in slow responses, high API costs, and context window exhaustion.
- **Decision:** Embed the Heimdall Token Saver engine natively into `vendor/token-saver/` within the core skills repository, providing context reduction on CLI tool outputs.
- **Consequences:** Cuts context payload sizes by 60–99% on CLI output while preserving critical stack traces, error codes, and assertions without external dependencies.

---

## ADR-011: Firecrawl Agentic Web Scraping Standard
- **Status:** Accepted
- **Context:** Extracting structured web data, executing multi-page site crawls, and interacting with JavaScript-rendered Web UI pages requires a standardized, resilient scraping toolset for agents.
- **Decision:** Standardize web data extraction on the Firecrawl CLI platform, integrating dedicated skills for structured JSON schema extraction (`firecrawl-agent`), bulk documentation crawling (`firecrawl-crawl`), page interaction (`firecrawl-interact`), site mapping (`firecrawl-map`), and deep search synthesis (`firecrawl-search`).
- **Consequences:** Provides reliable, LLM-optimized web data access and dynamic browser interaction across all agent workflows.
